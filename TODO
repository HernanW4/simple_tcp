[] Make a TcpPacket move between Server and Client. 
    [] Work on logic
    [X] Make packet contain a version
    [] Packet shall have a command
        Command is a char that tells the server/client what type of packet this is.
        Ex:
            Echo Packet,
            Data Packet,
            Disconnect Packet
    [X] Packet shall contain the data along with how long the data is
    [X] Packet shall also contain the author and target for such packet

[] Work on Error Handling
[] Make Client be able to do read and write separately. 
    Im thinking client shouldn't really write much, other than maybe some echos
    or asking for some data if missing
